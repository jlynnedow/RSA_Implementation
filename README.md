**What is RSA?**

The RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) cryptosystem is a family of public-key cryptosystems, one of the oldest widely used for secure data transmission. It is also fairly simple to implement,
making it a good place to start when learning about implementations of encryption algorithms.


**Implementation**


This project consists of 3 files, tools.c, tools.h, and rsa.c. tools.c contains implementations of the euclidean algorithm for calculationg gcd and the miller-rabin test for prime generation.  
rsa.c contains an implementation of rsa key generation, encryption, and decryption processes.

**Why RSA?**

This project was designed to help me strengthen both my low-level programming skills and my cybersecurity skills.
In my Number Systems class we learned about primality tests and the Chinsese remaineder theorem and their applications in computing, and
I wanted to try them out for myself.
