This project was designed to help me strengthen both my low-level programming skills and my cybersecurity skills.  


**Implementation**
This project consists of 3 files, tools.c, tools.h, and rsa.c. tools.c contains implementations of the euclidean algorithm for calculationg gcd and the miller-rabin test for prime generation.  
rsa.c contains an implementation of rsa key generation, encryption, and decryption processes.
